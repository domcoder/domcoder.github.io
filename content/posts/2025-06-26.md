## Tehir Minchenzatht Haraldson, wise hermetic wizard
My mentor and teacher, guide in my studies towards enlightening myself in the ways of the games we play. An ancient scholar and horder of knowledge, my time spent with him alas never fails to feel shorter than my preference. Long nights spent challenging the rules that govern the games we play, debates ringing on endlessly upon the peaceful hillside under his tower.

I am surprised to have made his acquaintance at all - the solitary fellow seldom passes his exterior threshold for anything less than nation-wide threats these days but I have my suspicions that in his past, he was quite the rambunctious and adventure-hungry fellow. Having met him through a friend grumbling about the wizard's tendancy to ignore his letters, my initial assumptions were challenged quickly once I discovered our shared passion for roleplaying games and to learn that he had spent much of his youth honing his craft was music to my ears. We soon developed a sustainably close working relaitonship as I busied myself plying critical information from his person for the world to experience his welfare of knowledge.

I will caution you, however. His mind leaps sharply to the rules and regulations surrounding the games we play and I have had a distinctly hard time attempting to win him over with notions such as home-brewed rules.


He is an ancient keeper of rules and always the first to correct an error in play - a habit I forgive due to his seniority and his accute bookkeeping skils.

## Sehkhepri (Seeki), loyal and lusterous scarab beetle familiar
If Sehkepri were to run a roleplaying game, she would be the kind of games master to lavish her playgroup with secrets and sights and lore beyond their wildest imaginations all while plotting their downfall with increasingly disturbing schemes. She would also lie a lot, for I and many others are yet to find a scarab beetle that cannot mask its deciet masterfully and I am certain that not all she tells me is fact.
