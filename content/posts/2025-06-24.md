##### Here's some notes I've made for the future of the website
# Notes
- Standardise containers & reduce overlap in code (mostly done)
- Find how to make the 'popular posts' section work
- Add some images to break everything
- Make a cultist SVG to test scaling
- Copyright Â© MysteryCultist 2025. All rights reserved.
- Write one decent-length blog (this one, probably)
- "I am the lord of the troupe, teller of stories and purveyor of small game pieces"
- Could probably shrink the size of the main page articles - the image could be smaller and the description text won't realistically fill the space
- Add more tags
- To-bottom button for blog/tag pages
- Find out how to do new lines in markdown

### Fun ideas
Set up a custom email


Cards template set up with hover and shadow (done)

#### Inspiration from Norwegian Reggeton, Nanowar of Steel
> She sets my heart ablaze like the arco-pyroclastic inferno of Notte La Dame. She's got eyes of a fresh-thawed Draugr and tortures my soul, enchanting my mind in violation of inter-continental treaties. She's living la vida loca as the catfolk say and she rips through my poems like a grimoir louse. She steals my breath longer than any arcane mishap.
