### Overview
For those endlessly trawling advice in search of the holy grail of ideas, here is a list for your consideration.

In the end, the only thing that matters is that your players felt like they were heard, and that they mattered and that they can make a difference.

### How Does It Fit Together
Your primary goal as a games master is to simulate an interesting world for your players to get to feel like their cool, silly and wildly foresightless actions mattered and made a difference in the game world.

In practice, none of this is nessasary to facilitate that - but it can help to generate varied ideas to 

## Combat
### Mechanical
#### Action economy
One of the biggest balancing factors in combat.
#### Initial engagement
Here are some types of combats that you could set up for your players to interact with:
-- Ambush
-- 
#### Enemy varierty
#### Damage range
#### Damage type
#### Terrain
#### Weather
#### Phase two

### Narrative
#### Objectives
#### Constraints
#### Foreshadowing
#### Morale
Give players alternate ways to win. Creatures that never run should be the mindless and the foolhardy - fights become more interesting when enemies break rank and suddenly players need to decide if the chase is worth their time. It's fun, it makes them feel cool and it's the best way to re-introduce survivors as mini villains later down the line.
#### Information
#### Repercussions

## Exploration
#### Five-room dungeon
#### Hex crawls
#### Point crawls
#### Dungeon crawls
#### Random encounters
#### Room exploration

## Roleplay
#### Reaction rolls
#### First and third person dialogue
#### Characters who like the party
A critical element for campaigns where the party play as heroes. The tangible effects of their good actions leading to genuine joy and happiness around them. And the reverse for evil campaigns - old mothers crying at the feet of the players for what they did to her son for the players to backhand away, cackling to themselves about their atrocities.

## Situations
The workload for a situation can be as extensive or minimal as you feel is worthwhile. But here are simple steps for an interesting session.
1. Create **three or four characters, representing larger factions** - though not nessasarily their leaders.
2. Build a **conflict between them** (or their underlings/families/friends). Draw from media, tropes, clich√©s and random tables for inspiration.
3. Set a time for the conflict - are the players finding the aftermath of the issue, appear during the height of the action or turn up just as it's about to start?
4. **Add a twist** or foreshadowing. Bring in a secret, additional faction, hide a secret motive or loyalty of an existing faction or lay the groundwork for a future plot with a mysterious item that nobody (even you, potentially) knows how it's connected to the conflict.


&nbsp;

For example. Betty is a villager, Gregor a bandit and Graww is a bear. Gregor has been hunting Graww's family, so Graww has been attacking nearby humanoids and has recently injured Betty's husband who is now lost in the woods. The twist is that Gregor's boss has been hired by the local lord's political rival and is attempting to sow discord into their lands. 

&nbsp;

After the session, you can review the situation and extrapolate new plots. If the bandits are all dead, the political rival might try something more drastic. If the bandits are alive, they may beg the players to save their families who are being used as blackmail. If the party were really interested in the bears, perhaps one of their caves has a dungeon inside that has *also* riled them up. If the townsfolk were the favourites of the session, the scenario turns towards a town celebration of the player's acomplishments.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the players decided to do something else - that's ok. Escalate the situation, if the characters are still in the locale - the bandits might grow bold and attack the settlement directly, or be gifted a druid by the political rival to focus the animal attacks.

## Session Preparation
Prepare one session at a time, only focusing on the immediate impact of the players.
